        <center><h5>How To Use Custom Functions</h5></center>
        <p>
            Common trig functions, including hyperbolics and inverses can be used.
            Exponentials should be written as "exp", and logs as "log".
            <br><br>Entering 5x does not work. Instead you should write 5*x.
            Write exponents as a^(exponent), so $x^2$ is writen as x^2.<br><br>
            Functions should be real and fully defined over the domain, for example log(x) is imaginary
            for values less than zero, so does not work.
            log(x+1) does not work either (with a period of 1), since log is undefined at zero, however
            log(1+x^2) does work for all periods, since it is defined over the whole domain and is real.
            <br><br>
            Sometimes due to the integration methods, the power spectrum shows very small values ($10^{-17}$).
            These are simply due to the inexact integration and should be treated as zero.
