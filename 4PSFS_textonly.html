    <h5 align="center">Power spectrum</h5>
    <p align="center">The power spectrum form is a different representation of a continuous signal. 
            One can think of a signal as a sound wave that is a superposition of different frequencies $\omega_n$, each with amplitude $\alpha_n$, and relative phases $\theta_n$.
            Any signal of period $2L$ can be decomposed in terms of the amplitude and relative phase of its discrete frequency modes. Its two parameters $\alpha_n$ and $\theta_n$, enable us to measure the amount of
            each frequency $\omega_n=\frac{n\pi}{L}$ contained in the signal, and the relative phase difference between the $n^{th}$ frequency and a cosine wave centered at $x=0$. This is simply a different way to represent a signal
            rather than decomposing it into its even and odd parts.</p>
        <p> $$ f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\alpha_n \cos\bigg(\frac{n\pi x}{L} - \theta_n\bigg)$$
        $$\alpha_n = \sqrt{{a^2_n} + {b^2_n}}$$
        $$\theta_n = \tan^{-1} \bigg(\frac{b_n}{a_n}\bigg)$$</p>

<div id = "Popup" class="divclass solidline">
    <p align="center"> For some even functions, when the period transitions from 0 to negative, the value of 
            $\theta_n$ change from $0$ to $\pi$ or vice versa. Why do you think
            this happens? (This happens because the value of $a_n$ changes sign ($b_n$ is 0) causing the value of 
            $\theta_n$ to change. For $b_n = 0$, $\tan^{-1}(\frac{b_n}{a_n})$ can be both
            0 or $\pi$ depending on whether $a_n$ is positive or negative. Not all even functions exhibit this. 
            The parabola for example, has its $a_n$ proportional to $L^2$, so its sign does not change when L changes sign.</p>
</div>
<h5 align="center">Orthogonal functions</h5>
    <p align="center">Two functions $f$ and $g$ are said to be orthogonal if their inner product $\langle f,g\rangle$ is 0. Just like basis vectors in a finite vector space,
            a set of orthogonal functions can form an infinite basis in a function space and a linear sum of these basis functions can describe any function in that function space.
            For functions that are periodic over $-L < x \leq L$ with a period of $2L$, the fourier components $\rightarrow$ $\sin(\frac{\pi x}{L}), \cos(\frac{\pi x}{L}),
            \sin(\frac{2\pi x}{L}), \cos(\frac{2\pi x}{L})...$ and so on form a complete orthogonal set that can be used to describe these functions. This means that increasing the amplitude of one of the components does not affect the other components, so changing the amount of any frequency contained
            in a signal leaves all the other frequencies unaffected.</p>
